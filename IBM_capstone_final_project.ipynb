    "I would like to compare and determine the best neighborhood in San Antonio, TX for tourists. San Antonio is a big city with a number of tourist sites. It has a local NBA team San Antonio Spurs, which draws NBA fans from all over the world each year. Moreover, with the historical connection with Mexican culture, the Mexican food there is a must try. I hope to give tourists a good recommendation on where to stay given their specific interests in the city.\n",

I will first determine the coordinates of these 9 neighborhoods. Then, for each neighborhood, I shall explore the nearby venues. Given that people usually drive in San Antonio, we may be able to set a larger radius, say 2 miles for now. I am also contemplating searching through the city and give scores based on the distance.\n",
